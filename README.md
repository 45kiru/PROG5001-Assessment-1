# PROG5001-Assessment-1

A simple program to compute statistics of 'students' marks

##  Functional Requirements:
1. **F1:** Allows the user to input the assignment name.

2. **F2:** Allows the user to input students' marks for the assignment. In this task, you can assume that there are 30 students in the unit. Your program must accept only valid mark inputs by users. A valid mark is any number between 0 and 30.

3. **F3:** Reports any invalid input by showing an error message on the screen to the user with sufficient details of the error before allowing users to re-enter the mark.

4. **F4:** Prints the assignment name following the 'students' marks after users have finished entering the marks.

5. **F5:** Prints the highest mark and the lowest mark on the screen. You are required to complete this functional requirement in two steps:

   - **Step 1:** Create an algorithm (called Algorithm 1) in pseudo code to print the highest mark and the lowest mark on the screen.

   - **Step 2:** Implement Algorithm 1 based on the pseudo code you created in Step 1. Note that the implementation must be in line with the pseudo code. Also, you are not allowed to use existing searching and sorting library functions in Algorithm 1.

6. **F6:** Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the marks and print the result on the screen. Like in F5, you are required to complete this functional requirement in two steps:

   - **Step 1:** Create an algorithm (called Algorithm 2) in pseudo code to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the marks.

   - **Step 2:** Implement Algorithm 2 based on the pseudo code you created in Step 1. Note that the implementation must be in line with the pseudo code. Also, you are not allowed to use existing library functions to calculate means and standard deviations in Algorithm 2.
